## Why I use this template with Angular CLI
* `Angular 2.0 R3` and strives to keep up with the latest releases of Angular 2.0
* `Router v3.0` and has examples on using general and dynamic routing.
* Uses a template back-end server with `NodeJS`
* `Bootstrap v4.0`
* `Material 2` - Using Bootstrap mostly until Material 2 is officially released
* `Android's Roboto Font` as defined by [Google Material](https://material.google.com/style/typography.html)
* Icons to use already - `Ionicons`, `Glyphicons`, `Font-Awesome`
* Example of using `HTTP` Service through a `TodoService` that talks to MongoDB through NodeJS
* Example on how to use the `TodoService` in a component and display the data

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.8.

## Development server

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
